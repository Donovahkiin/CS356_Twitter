# CS356_Twitter
Project 2 - Create a mini twitter application using Java Swing

To compile: rename the folders cs356_twitter.observerPattern and cs 356_twitter.visitorPattern to just observerPattern and visitorPattern.

observerPattern and visitorPattern were saved as packages of that name under CS365_Twitter Source Packages.
